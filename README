BrainGame is a rather challenging game, written in Python with kivy.

I made this game for the kivycontest#2014, and i pretty much got in love with kivy :)
(This is my first ever written kivy aplication)

The point of the game is to press the button, which spell text's color correctly.
Which is challenging because of the Stroop effect.

"In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.
When the name of a color (e.g., "blue," "green," or "red") is printed in a color
not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink),
naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when
the color of the ink matches the name of the color."

Correct answers worth 1 point, wrong ones give you -1 point.

Requirements:
  - The 3 files should be in the same directory
  - Kivy 1.8.0 Python3.3 version, it should work with the others as well
  - Tried it on Windows and Linux, not tested on Mac! (but it could work)
  
Hope you enjoy playing it!
